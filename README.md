# Usage

```sh
$ npm install hayreddintuzel/quiz-with-react
$ npm start
$ json-server --watch db.json --port 3004
```
  - this package created with create-react-app and it uses port 3000. So, you should operate json-server at a different port.
  - You can manipulate database's data by changing db.json file.
  - Please help me for improving this basic package. I am opening to your feedbacks. It is first version of this package.
